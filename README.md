# Optimized-MNIST-Digit-Classification-through-Feature-Selection-and-Dimensionality-Reduction
In this project, I applied various dimensionality reduction techniques (Autoencoder, ICA, PCA) and feature selection methods (SelectKBest, RFE, f_classif, Lasso) to improve K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) performance on MNIST digit classification. The goal was to enhance accuracy by optimizing feature representation
